# emque-stats

[ ![Codeship Status for
teamsnap/emque-stats](https://www.codeship.io/projects/e9d694d0-9eb3-0132-75d9-56e0c71a690d/status)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/64928)

A library that provides any [Emque::Producing](https://github.com/teamsnap/emque-producing)
application instrumentation capabilities for collecting application statistics
and events. Stats and events are sent as just another Emque message through the
Message Broker (RabbitMQ).

A separate [Emque::Consuming](https://github.com/teamsnap/emque-consuming)
service must be created and deployed to process the data. In doing so, you can
use your preferred graphing or analytics solution, be it Graphite, StatsD,
New Relic, Keen.io, etc.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'emque-stats'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install emque-stats

## Usage

For any app already using Emque::Producing, there is nothing further to do.
Emque::Stats will re-use the same configuration.

For an app that is not already using Emque::Producing.

``` ruby
  Emque::Stats.configure do |config|
    emque_configuration = Emque::Producing::Configuration.new
    emque_configuration.app_name = "your_app"
    emque_configuration.rabbitmq_options = { :url => "your rabbitmq url" }
    config.emque_producing_configuration = emque_configuration
  end
```

Send some stats

``` ruby
  # track activity
  Emque::Stats.track("login", {:user_id => 1, :another_property => "something"} )

  # counter
  Emque::Stats.increment("garets")
  Emque::Stats.count("garets", 20)

  # timing
  Emque::Stats.timer("glork", 320)

  # gauge
  Emque::Stats.gauge("bork", 100)
```

## Tests

To run tests...
